# Suggested GitHub Labels

Use these labels to triage issues and PRs. Adjust colors as needed.

- bug (red): problems that cause incorrect behavior
- enhancement (blue): feature requests and improvements
- documentation (gray): README, docs, wiki updates
- performance (orange): performance-related tasks
- security (dark red): vulnerabilities and security work
- infra / ops (purple): CI, deployment, infra tasks
- qa (lime): testing, flaky tests, test coverage
- ux (pink): design and UI/UX tasks
- backlog (light gray): triaged but not scheduled
- help wanted (green): community contributions
- good first issue (teal): small tasks for new contributors
- epic (gold): grouping of related work / bigger initiative

Use combinations of labels: e.g., `security` + `high` or `performance` + `P1` for priorities.
